# AisiomAR
Aisiom (pronounced "ay-shom" - which means "to learn" in Ateso, a native language of Uganda) is an Android tool that utilizes Qualcomm's Vuforia Augmented Reality framework to teach kids stuff using games.
#Requirements
You will need to download the following tools to run the tool on your computer:
a) Android Developer Tools: Download Eclipse at https://eclipse.org/juno/ and the ADT plugin at http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adt.html
Note: You can use Android Studio as well but the tool has not yet been tested using this IDE. 
b) Android NDK: Download at http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html
c) Vuforia SDK: Download at https://developer.vuforia.com/resources/sdk/android
d)Java SDK 7

#Deployment
To run the the app on your Android device, install the AisiomAR.apk (make sure you have correct security permission in your settings).
Print the image marker ImageTargetBananas.pdf (in the assets folder).
After launching the app, point the camera to the printed image marker and interact with the on-screen buttons. 

Note: Using the Android emulator will not give you the best experience as some functionality can't be correctly emulated. 
Have fun
